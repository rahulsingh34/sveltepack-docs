## Authentication in sveltepack
Out of the box, sveltepack has traditional email/password authentication for users

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Register">
        The /register route hosts a form for users to create accounts.

        The `registrationHandler` function handles requests in the following ways:
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Success">
                User will be logged in and redirected to dashboard.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Error">
                Trigger a toast and remain on the registration route. Will triggered if credentials and invalid.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Duplicate Account">
                Trigger a toast and navigate to the login route.
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Login">
        The /login route hosts a form for users log into their accounts.

        The `loginHandler` function handles requests in the following ways:
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Success">
                User will be logged in and redirected to dashboard.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Error">
                Trigger a toast and stays on login page. For account safety, the same general error toast will appear regardless of whether the credentials are incorrect or invalid.
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Logout">
        A logged in user can log out by clicking the avatar on the top right, then clicking sign out in the dropdown menu. The authentication state is available globally through the app and a logout button can be created anywhere through following snippet:
        ```typescript
        {#if $userTokenStore}
            <button on:click={() => supabase.auth.signOut()}>Sign Out</button>
        {/if}
        ```
        The `$userTokenStore` will hold the auth state and you can use it to dynamically display a sign out button on your app.

        <Note>Don't forget to import the store from your $lib</Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Reset Password">
        #### Setup
        Navigate to <a href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank">Supabase</a> and head to your project's dashboard.
        <Steps>
        <Step title="Configure Site URL">
            Go to Authentication, then click URL Configuration, change your site url. For testing you can use localhost if you wish.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Adjust Email Template">
            Still under Authentication, click Email Templates. Go to the Reset Password template and enter the following:
            ```html
            <h2>Reset Password</h2>

            <p>Follow this link to reset the password for your user:</p>
            <p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}update-password">Reset Password</a></p>
            ```
            You may wish to change the styling but ensure that the your reset link points to `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}update-password` as shown above
        </Step>
        </Steps>

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Success">
                A toast will be trigger and if account is found a magic link will be sent to the user's email. Clicking the link will log in the user and they can update their password.

            <Tab title="Error">
                A toast will be triggered and nothing will happen.

                A toast will be trigger and the user's password will be reset. Consider adding additional business logic to route the user elsewhere or force them to sign in again.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Error">
                A toast will be triggered and nothing will happen.
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Protecting Routes
In an effort to preserve simplicity, client side authentication is used. As a result, route protection will occur on the client side and should be paired with RLS policies to prevent sensitive data from getting into the wrong hands.

With that, there is a handy route protection function in your $lib called `protectedRoute`. It can be imported to any page or layout using the following line:
```typescript
import { protectedRoute } from '$lib';
```
And you can use it by wrapping it in an onMount function within your page or layout.
```typescript
onMount(async () => {
    protectedRoute()
})
```
The function will redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

<Warning>Data fetching may still occur before user is redirected, so be sure to use RLS on your tables. The <a href="features/database" target="_blank">Database</a> section will cover this in more detail.</Warning>

## Third-Party Authentication Providers
Supabase offers several authentication methods and providers. An in depth guide for each one can be found <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth" target="_blank">here</a>.
