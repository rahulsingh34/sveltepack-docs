## Authentication in sveltepack
Out of the box, sveltepack has traditional email/password authentication for users

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Register">
        The /register route hosts a form for users to create accounts.

        The `registrationHandler` function handles requests in the following ways:
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Success">
                User will be logged in. Add your business logic to the function (see comment in `/register/+page.svelte`). Consider navigating authenticated users a dashboard or other route.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Error">
                Trigger a toast and remain on the registration route. Will triggered if credentials and invalid.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Duplicate Account">
                Trigger a toast and navigate to the login route.
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Login">
        The /login route hosts a form for users log into their accounts.

        The `loginHandler` function handles requests in the following ways:
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Success">
                User will be logged in. Add your business logic to the function (see comment in `/login/+page.svelte`). Consider navigating authenticated users a dashboard or other route.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Error">
                Trigger a toast and stays on login page. For account safety, the same general error toast will appear regardless of whether the credentials are incorrect or invalid.
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Logout">
        Once a user is logged in, on the login page you will see a Sign Out button. The authentication state is available globally through the app and a logout button can be created anywhere through following snippet:
        ```typescript
        {#if $userTokenStore}
            <button on:click={() => supabase.auth.signOut()}>Sign Out</button>
        {/if}
        ```
        The `$userTokenStore` will hold the auth state and you can use it to dynamically display a sign out button on your app.

        <Note>Don't forget to import the store for your $lib</Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Reset Password">
        #### Setup
        Navigate to <a href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank">Supabase</a> and head to your project's dashboard.
        <Steps>
        <Step title="Configure Site URL">
            Go to Authentication, then click URL Configuration, change your site url. For testing you can use localhost if you wish.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Adjust Email Template">
            Still under Authentication, click Email Templates. Go to the Reset Password template and enter the following:
            ```html
            <h2>Reset Password</h2>

            <p>Follow this link to reset the password for your user:</p>
            <p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}update-password">Reset Password</a></p>
            ```
            You may wish to change the styling but ensure that the your reset link points to `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}update-password` as shown above
        </Step>
        </Steps>

        #### Usage
        The /reset-password route hosts a form for users reset their own password.

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Success">
                A toast will be trigger and if account is found a magic link will be sent to the user's email. Clicking the link will log in the user and they can update their password.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Error">
                A toast will be triggered and nothing will happen.
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        <Warning>Supabase has rate limits for emails and it is recommended that you send emails through your own provider</Warning>
    </Accordion>

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Success">
                A toast will be trigger and the user's password will be reset. Consider adding additional business logic to route the user elsewhere or force them to sign in again.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Error">
                A toast will be triggered and nothing will happen.
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Protecting Routes
In an effort to preserve simplicity, client side authentication is used. As a result, route protection will occur on the client side and should be paired with RLS policies to prevent sensitive data from getting into the wrong hands.

With that, there is a handy route protection function in your $lib called `protectedRoute`. It can be imported to any page or layout using the following line:
```typescript
import { protectedRoute } from '$lib';
```
And you can use it by wrapping it in an onMount function within your page or layout.
```typescript
onMount(async () => {
    protectedRoute()
})
```
The function will redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

<Warning>Data fetching may still occur before user is redirected, so be sure to use RLS on your tables. The <a href="features/database" target="_blank">Database</a> section will cover this in more detail.</Warning>

## Third-Party Authentication Providers
Supabase offers several authentication methods and providers. An indepth guide for each one can be found <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth" target="_blank">here</a>.
